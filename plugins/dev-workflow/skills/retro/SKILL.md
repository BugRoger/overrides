# Session Retrospective

Analyze the current session to improve agent instructions.

## Process

Run phases in order. Each phase is conversational — wait for feedback before proceeding.

1. **[Review & Remember](references/review-and-remember.md)** — Identify findings, decide where to store them
2. **[Engineering Dance Off](references/engineering-dance-off.md)** — Optional deep analysis for substantial changes

## Quick Exit

If the session was short or routine with nothing notable, say "Nothing to improve" and end.
