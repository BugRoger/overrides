# Phase: Engineering Dance Off

**When to use:** Only for sessions with substantial changes or complex findings. Skip for routine sessions.

---

Simulate two experts analyzing the changes made in this session:

## Round 1: Independent Analysis

**Expert A** (Software Engineering & Architecture):
- Review code changes for design patterns, maintainability, scalability
- Suggest improvements or refactorings

**Expert B** (Prompt Engineering & AI Workflows):
- Review instruction changes for clarity, completeness, efficiency
- Suggest improvements to CLAUDE.md, rules, or memory

## Round 2: Critique

Each expert critiques the other's suggestions:
- What's missing?
- What's over-engineered?
- What are the tradeoffs?

## Round 3: CTO Decision

Simulated CTO weighs the discussion:
- Which suggestions have the best ROI?
- What's the minimal change that captures the learning?
- Final prioritized list of changes

Present the final proposal to the user. **Do not implement changes** — wait for approval.
